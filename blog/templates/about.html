<p>Hi there friend! I'm JC, and welcome to my blog -JCable</p>
<P>I am a MSc Computing student at the Cardiff University. </P>

<p>Blogging is relatively new to me, and I believe I can do more to help JCable reaches its high potential. </p>
<p>Feedback and suggetions are welcomed, and please feel free to contact me</p> {%
